![Website](https://img.shields.io/website?url=https%3A%2F%2Fchandanshakya.com.np%2Fblog&style=social)

Welcome to the repository for my personal blog, hosted at [ChandanShakya.com.np/blog](http://chandanshakya.com.np/blog).

This blog is built using Jekyll, a static site generator. Each blog post is an individual Markdown file in the `_posts` directory. The naming convention for these files is `YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`.

## Layouts

The main layout for the pages is defined in `_layouts/default.html`. This layout includes the site's header, footer, and other common elements. The content of each post is rendered using the layout specified in `_layouts/post.html`.

## Styles

The styles for the site are located in the `assets` directory. The main stylesheets are `frame.css` and `index.css`.

## Pages

The site's main page is `index.html`, and the 404 error page is `404.html`. The site also includes an archive page, `archive.html`, which lists all blog posts.

## Contributing
